      <h1>Chapter lll</h1>
      <p>
        "Information Processing Cycle," outlines the sequence of events in processing information, which includes input, processing, storage, and output.
         Input involves acquiring, entering, and validating data, while processing refers to the application of instructions to data to generate organized information. 
         Storage is for saving information for future use, and output is about sending information to users in a usable format. 
         The chapter also distinguishes between data, which are raw facts and figures, and information, which is processed data that has meaningful value for the receiver.

        Introduces the concept of a Computer System, which is the interaction between entities, processes, and operations using a computer. 
        It outlines the four main components of a computer system: Hardware, Software, People ware, and Data ware. 
        Hardware includes physical components like input, output, storage devices, memory, processors, and scanning devices. 
        Software is divided into system software, which runs the computer itself, and application software, which performs tasks for users. 
        People ware refers to the individuals using and working with computers. Lastly, Data ware encompasses the tools and systems for data management and analysis,
         highlighting the transformation of data into usable information for humans.

        Computer security, or cybersecurity, defends computer systems, networks, and data against unauthorized access, attacks,
         or harm by emphasizing principles such as confidentiality through encryption, integrity using measures like checksums,
          availability with redundancy and backups, authentication via methods like passwords and biometrics, authorization through 
          access control lists, firewalls for network control, antivirus and anti-malware protection, regular software updates 
          to address vulnerabilities, user education on security risks, and incident response plans encompassing detection, 
          containment, eradication, recovery, and learning from events. Organizations integrate technical and procedural measures 
          for a holistic security approach.
